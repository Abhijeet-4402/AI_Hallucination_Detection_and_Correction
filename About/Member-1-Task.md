My primary goal is to build the Retrieval Module, which is the foundational data layer of the system. I will be responsible for setting up the knowledge base and the tools needed to retrieve factual evidence for the detection and correction modules.

Phase 1: Setup and Data Sourcing (Weeks 1–2)
(This phase focuses on setting up the environment and acquiring the necessary data assets for the system.)

Task 1.1: Environment and Library Setup

Action: Set up a Python virtual environment and install the required libraries: datasets, wikipedia, chromadb, and sentence-transformers.

Task 1.2: Source and Load Dataset

Action: Load the TruthfulQA dataset from Hugging Face using the datasets library to use as a benchmark for testing the system.


Task 1.3: Set up Evidence Retrieval

Action: Implement a function that uses the wikipedia API to fetch real-time evidence documents based on a user's question or prompt.

Phase 2: Building the Retrieval Pipeline (Weeks 3–4)
(This phase focuses on creating the core retrieval logic using the sourced data and tools.)

Task 2.1: Implement Text Embedding
Action: Use the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model from sentence-transformers to generate embeddings for the retrieved text documents. This will allow for semantic search within the knowledge base.


Task 2.2: Set up Vector Database
Action: Set up ChromaDB to store the text embeddings and their corresponding documents. This will serve as a fast and efficient knowledge base for the system.

Task 2.3: Create the Retrieval Function
Action:

Define a main function retrieve_evidence(question: str) -> list[str].

Inside this function, take the user's question, use the wikipedia API to retrieve relevant documents, embed them using the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model, and store/search them in ChromaDB.

The function should return a list of the most relevant documents (

top documents) to be passed downstream to the detection and correction modules.


Phase 3: System Integration (Weeks 4-5)
(This phase focuses on connecting my module with the rest of the project pipeline, ensuring a seamless flow of data.)

Task 3.1: Integrate with Detection Module (Member 2)
Description: My module's output is a crucial input for Member 2's detection module.


Action: Collaborate with Member 2 to ensure my retrieve_evidence function provides the evidence_docs in the correct format for their detect_hallucination function.


Task 3.2: Integrate with Correction Module (Member 3)
Description: My retrieved evidence is also needed by the correction module to regenerate a factual answer.


Action: Confirm with Member 3 that the output format of my retrieve_evidence function is compatible with the input requirements of their correct_answer function.


🤝 Integration Points
My module is the first major component in the system pipeline after the initial user query and the LLM's raw answer.

My Inputs (Dependencies):

I will receive the user's 

question from the main pipeline.


My Outputs (Deliverables):

I will provide a list of
